# Programming exercise: Fix the code: Utterances
# https://programming-24.mooc.fi/part-1/2-information-from-the-user
#
# Here is a program which should ask for three utterances and print them out, like so:
# The 1st part: hickory
# The 2nd part: dickory
# The 3rd part: dock
# hickory-dickory-dock!
# 
# However, there is something wrong with the code below. Please fix it.

part1 = input("The 1st part: ")
part2 = input("The 2nd part: ")
part3 = input("The 3rd part: ")
print(part1 + "-" + part2 + "-" + part3 + "!")
