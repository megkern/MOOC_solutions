# Programming exercise: The sum of consecutive numbers, version 1
# https://programming-24.mooc.fi/part-3/1-loops-with-conditions
#
# Please write a program which asks the user to type in a limit. 
# The program then calculates the sum of consecutive numbers (1 + 2 + 3 + ...) 
# until the sum is at least equal to the limit set by the user. 
# The program should function as follows:
# Limit: 2
# 3
# Limit: 10
# 10

up = int(input("Limit: "))
x1 = 1
sum = 0
while sum < up:
    sum += x1 # or sum = sum + x1
    x1 += 1 # put this line before the sum line if you initialize sum at 1

print(sum)

# Notes:
#
# Limit: 1
# 1 = 1
#
# Limit: 2
# 1+2 = 3
#
# Limit: 3
# 1+2 = 3
#
# Limit: 4
# 1+2+3 = 6
#
# Limit: 5
# 1+2+3 = 6 
#
# Limit: 6
# 1+2+3 = 6 
#
# Limit: 7
# 1+2+3+4 = 10
#
# Limit: 8
# 1+2+3+4 = 10
#
# Limit: 9
# 1+2+3+4 = 10
#
# Limit: 10
# 1+2+3+4 = 10 
#
